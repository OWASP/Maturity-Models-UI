An SSDL process must be adapted to the specifics of the development process it governs (e.g., waterfall, agile, etc) and evolves both with the organization and the security landscape.

In its most dangerous form, such education arrives courtesy of malicious hackers or public data exposure incidents. Preferably, the SSG demonstrates a worst-case scenario in a controlled environment with the permission of all involved (e.g., actually showing working exploits and their business impact).

The first two steps toward establishing security-specific release gates are: 1) to identify gate locations that are compatible with existing development practices and 2) to begin gathering the input necessary for making a go/no-go decision. Importantly at this stage, the gates are not enforced. For example, the SSG can collect security testing results for each project prior to release, but stop short of passing judgment on what constitutes sufficient testing or acceptable test results. The idea of identifying gates first and only enforcing them later is extremely helpful in moving development toward software security without major pain.

In some cases, gates are directly associated with controls required by regulations, contractual agreements, and other business obligations, and exceptions are tracked as required by statutory or regulatory drivers. In other cases, gate measures yield key performance indicators that are used to govern the process. A revolving door or a rubber stamp exception process does not count.

A reduction in security defect density could be used to show a decreasing cost of remediation over time.

Informal risk acceptance alone does not count as security sign off, as the act of accepting risk is more effective when it is formalized (e.g., with a signature, form submission, or something similar) and captured for future reference.

A formal approach will map applicable portions of regulations to control statements explaining how the organization complies. As an alternative, existing business processes run by legal or other risk and compliance groups outside the SSG could also serve as the regulatory focal point.

The SSG plays a key role in identifying and describing PII obligations stemming from regulation and customer expectations. It uses this information to promote best practices related to privacy. For example, if the organization processes credit card transactions, the SSG will identify the constraints that the PCI DSS places on the handling of cardholder data and inform all stakeholders.

Likewise, project teams don’t need to re-learn customer security requirements on their own.

In some cases, policy documents relate directly to the SSDL and its use in the firm. Architecture standards and coding guidelines are not examples of software security policy.
