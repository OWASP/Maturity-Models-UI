Most organizations pick and choose from a published methodology, such as the Microsoft SDL or the Cigital Touchpoints, and then tailor the methodology to their needs. An SSDL process must be adapted to the specifics of the development process it governs (e.g., waterfall, agile, etc) and evolves both with the organization and the security landscape. A process must be published to count. In many cases, the methodology is published only internally and is controlled by the SSG.

A canonical example of such an evangelist was Michael Howard’s role at Microsoft just after the Gates memo.","resources":[],"objective":"","proof":""},"SM.1.3":{"description":"Executives are periodically shown the consequences of inadequate software security and the negative business impact that poor security can have. They’re also shown what other organizations are doing to attain software security. By understanding both the problem and its proper resolution, executives come to support the software security initiative as a risk management necessity. In its most dangerous form, such education arrives courtesy of malicious hackers or public data exposure incidents. Preferably, the SSG demonstrates a worst-case scenario in a controlled environment with the permission of all involved (e.g., actually showing working exploits and their business impact).

The first two steps toward establishing security-specific release gates are: 1) to identify gate locations that are compatible with existing development practices and 2) to begin gathering the input necessary for making a go/no-go decision. Importantly at this stage, the gates are not enforced. For example, the SSG can collect security testing results for each project prior to release, but stop short of passing judgment on what constitutes sufficient testing or acceptable test results. The idea of identifying gates first and only enforcing them later is extremely helpful in moving development toward software security without major pain. Socialize the gates, and only turn them on once most projects already know how to succeed.

In other cases, open book management and publishing data to all stakeholders helps everyone know what’s going on, with the philosophy that sunlight is the best disinfectant.

In some cases, gates are directly associated with controls required by regulations, contractual agreements, and other business obligations, and exceptions are tracked as required by statutory or regulatory drivers. In other cases, gate measures yield key performance indicators that are used to govern the process. A revolving door or a rubber stamp exception process does not count.

A reduction in security defect density could be used to show a decreasing cost of remediation over time.

Informal risk acceptance alone does not count as security sign off, as the act of accepting risk is more effective when it is formalized (e.g., with a signature, form submission, or something similar) and captured for future reference.

A formal approach will map applicable portions of regulations to control statements explaining how the organization complies. As an alternative, existing business processes run by legal or other risk and compliance groups outside the SSG could also serve as the regulatory focal point.

For example, if the organization processes credit card transactions, the SSG will identify the constraints that the PCI DSS places on the handling of cardholder data and inform all stakeholders. Note that outsourcing to hosted environments (e.g., the cloud) does not relax a majority of PII obligations.

Likewise, project teams don’t need to re-learn customer security requirements on their own. The SSG policy documents are sometimes focused around major compliance topics such as the handling of PII or the use of cryptography. In some cases, policy documents relate directly to the SSDL and its use in the firm. Architecture standards and coding guidelines are not examples of software security policy.

Ideally, the organization will create a secure base configuration for each technology stack, further reducing the amount of work required to use the stack safely. A stack might include an operating system, a database, an application server, and a runtime environment for a managed language. The security frontier is a good place to find traction. Currently, mobile technology stacks and platforms as well as cloud-based technology stacks are two areas where specific attention to security pays off.","resources":[],"objective":"","proof":""},"SR.2.4":{"description":"The first step toward managing risk introduced by open source is to identify the open source components in use across the portfolio. It’s not uncommon to discover old versions of components with known vulnerabilities or multiple versions of the same component. Automated tools for finding open source, whether whole components or large chunks of borrowed code, are one way to approach this activity. A process that relies solely on developers asking for permission does not generate satisfactory results. At the next level of maturity, this activity is subsumed by a policy constraining the use of open source.","resources":[],"objective":"","proof":""},"SR.2.5":{"description":"The SSG works with the legal department to create a standard SLA boilerplate that is used in contracts with vendors and outsource providers to require software security efforts. The legal department understands that the boilerplate also helps prevent compliance and privacy problems. Under the agreement, vendors and outsource providers must meet company software security standards (see CP2.4 Paper all vendor contracts with software security SLAs). Boilerplate language may call out software security vendor control solutions such as vBSIMM measurements or BSIMM scores.","resources":[],"objective":"","proof":""},"SR.2.6":{"description":"Secure coding standards help developers avoid the most obvious bugs and provide ground rules for code review. Secure coding standards are necessarily specific to a programming language and can address the use of popular frameworks and libraries. If the organization already has coding standards for other purposes, the secure coding standards should build upon them. A clear set of secure coding standards is a good way to guide both manual and automated code review, as well as beefing up security training with relevant examples. Remember, guidance does not a standard make.","resources":[],"objective":"","proof":""},"SR.3.1":{"description":"The organization has control over its exposure to the vulnerabilities that come along with using open source components. Use of open source could be restricted to pre-defined projects. It could also be restricted to open source versions that have been through an SSG security screening process, had unacceptable vulnerabilities remediated, and made available only through internal repositories. Legal often spearheads additional open source controls due to the “viral” license problem associated with GPL code. Getting legal to understand security risks can help move an organization to practice decent open source hygiene. Of course, this control must be applied across the software portfolio.","resources":[],"objective":"","proof":""},"SR.3.2":{"description":"The SSG works with vendors to educate them and promote the organization’s security standards. A healthy relationship with a vendor cannot be guaranteed through contract language alone. The SSG engages with vendors, discusses the vendor’s security practices and explains in concrete terms (rather than legalese) what the organization expects of the vendor. Any time a vendor adopts the organization’s security standards, it’s a clear win. When a firm’s SSDL is available publically, communication regarding software security expectations is easier. Likewise, sharing internal practices and measures can make expectations very clear.","resources":[],"objective":"","proof":""},"":{"description":"","resources":[],"objective":"","proof":""}}}
